# AI Native Organizations

A proposed framework for defining engineering roles in the age of AI-assisted development.

---

## Purpose

Software engineering is changing faster than job descriptions can keep up.

AI coding tools have shifted what it means to "build software." The most effective 
engineers increasingly orchestrate human-AI workflows rather than writing every 
line themselvesâ€”but most job descriptions still assume purely manual implementation.

**This repository proposes a solution.**

We define the **[Senior Software Orchestration Engineer](./senior-software-orchestration-engineer.md)**: a role focused on 
designing, governing, and improving AI-augmented development systems rather than 
maximizing personal code output.

This is an **early-stage proposal** seeking community input, real-world validation, 
and eventual adoption as a shared reference across the industry.

## Motivation

In AI-forward engineering teams:
- Tools like Copilot and Cursor now generate 30-60% of code
- Engineering value increasingly comes from oversight, architecture, and orchestration
- Traditional metrics (lines of code, commits) no longer reflect true contribution

Yet most Senior Engineer job descriptions were written for a pre-AI era.

**We believe the industry needs:**
- Clear language for these emerging responsibilities
- Practical hiring criteria that reflect orchestration skills
- Shared standards that prevent fragmentation as practices evolve

This repository is our starting point. **We need your help to refine it.**
