# AI Native Organizations

**Senior Software Orchestration Engineer**

A practical, community-maintained framework for defining the next generation of senior engineering roles in the age of AI-assisted development.

> **Purpose:**  
> Senior Engineers no longer write all the code themselves — they design the workflows, guardrails, and knowledge systems that ensure human-AI collaboration produces reliable, ethical, and high-impact software.

---

## 1. Overview

This job description defines a **Senior Software Orchestration Engineer**:  
an engineer who leads human-AI workflows rather than just contributing individual code.

They ensure that:
- AI tools are used safely and effectively,  
- team practices adapt to new automation, and  
- engineering knowledge is codified into systems that scale.

> 🧩 **Goal:** Establish a starting point that teams can fork, adapt, and extend as AI-assisted engineering matures.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

### A. Human–AI Development Workflow
- Design and maintain workflows where AI assists with coding, testing, documentation, or review.  
- Evaluate AI-generated output for correctness, maintainability, and security.  
- Create structured prompts, templates, or scripts that make AI contributions predictable and auditable.  
- Deliverables: prompt patterns, verification scripts, and reproducible examples.

### B. Engineering Effectiveness
- Identify repetitive or slow workflows; introduce AI-driven improvements.  
- Build or maintain internal libraries and playbooks for responsible AI use.  
- Measure adoption and performance of AI tools within the team.  
- Deliverables: Copilot usage playbook, productivity metrics, prompt template library.

### C. Knowledge Codification
- Translate team best practices into reusable artifacts (linting rules, code review prompts, internal docs).  
- Mentor peers on effective AI collaboration and validation techniques.  
- Deliverables: “AI review rubric,” prompt patterns, annotated PR examples.

### D. Ethical and Reliable AI Use
- Apply company AI standards for data privacy, security, and compliance.  
- Identify potential risks in AI outputs (bias, leakage, unsafe automation).  
- Escalate or mitigate issues through transparent review and documentation.  
- Deliverables: safety checklists, red-team reports, audit logs.

## 3. Evaluation Criteria

Performance focuses on **impact and reproducibility**, not coding volume.

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Effectiveness** | Faster cycle time; improved review latency; reduction in manual rework |
| **Quality** | Fewer regressions or defects in AI-assisted code |
| **Adoption** | Reusable prompt libraries or workflows shared across teams |
| **Ethics & Safety** | Consistent documentation and auditability of AI use |
| **Mentorship** | Demonstrated coaching impact through improved team AI fluency |

---

## 4. Competencies

| Domain | Expected Proficiency |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Software Engineering** | Strong foundation in system design, testing, CI/CD, and code review |
| **AI Tooling** | Practical experience with AI coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Claude Code) |
| **Workflow Design** | Ability to define and iterate on AI-assisted development pipelines |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Writes context-rich prompts that drive consistent results |
| **Documentation & Mentorship** | Codifies tacit team wisdom into durable systems and guides |
| **Ethical Stewardship** | Applies transparency, safety, and human-in-the-loop principles |

---

## 5. Career Path Context

| Level | Description | Focus |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Engineer (AI-Aware)** | Uses AI tools effectively for personal productivity | Execution |
| **Senior Software Orchestration Engineer** | Designs and maintains team-level AI workflows and standards | Reliability |
| **Staff Engineer (AI Architect)** | Defines org-wide orchestration systems and governance | Scale |

> The Orchestrator level represents the shift from *AI usage* to *AI system design* within an engineering team.

## 6. Qualifications

- Strong background in software engineering and architecture.  
- Demonstrated success integrating AI-assisted tools into production workflows.  
- Experience improving engineering processes and mentoring peers.  
- Familiarity with metrics such as cycle time, change failure rate, and MTTR.  
- Commitment to responsible AI use, continuous learning, and ethical design.

**Preferred (Aspirational)**
- Exposure to multi-agent systems, verification pipelines, or ACE-style orchestration environments.  
- Experience contributing to internal standards, frameworks, or open-source tooling.
